# Robot Object Retrieval with Contextual Natural Language Queries
- Read the paper: http://www.roboticsproceedings.org/rss16/p080.pdf
- Watch the virtual conference presentation: https://youtu.be/HOYvL5AwX38
- To evaluate the trained model, run *eval.py* with the desired mode (YCB, robot, eval)
- The annotated dataset of 655 verb-object pairs can be found at **data/annotated-vo.csv** (a valid verb-object pair is annotated with label "1")
- We also release a smaller dataset of 88 verb-object pairs over a subset of verbs from our original dataset and objects from the YCB object set, this dataset can be found at **data/ycb-verb-object.csv**
- To train and evaluate your own model on our dataset, run *run.py* (you will first need to run *resnet.py* to generate embeddings for your objects, and *gen_data.py* to generate train and test data for the model)
- **corpus-train.csv** and **object-embedding.csv** can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14h_AxGwJgGFOqdqouaZYM9cqEItXL3TY?usp=sharing)
